This GitHub repository contains the scripts and data to recreate the experimental results given in the paper. The three values of s that were tested are listed out, alongside the corresponding analysis scripts and generated .csv files for the visibility data.

Experiments A through D represent the 4 different detectors. The different s values are the 3 different RTN experiments mentioned in the paper. The raw_videos directory present within each s value is the cropped and centered (for analytic consistency across detectors and s values) video used within each analysis.

Videos above a certain limit struggle to fit on YouTube, so some videos were placed on YouTube. If one desires to recreate the analysis, the videos presented can be downloaded from YouTube using this link: https://ytmp4.is/en/ (at the user's own risk).

This paper acknowledges Dr. Gary Oas for his guidance throughout the project.
